			<p style="color: white;">You waved at the apartment&rsquo;s camera to identify yourself. The system granted you exit and opened the metal door leading to the streets.<br>
There are cameras like this throughout the city, Authority said they are for everyone&rsquo;s safety, as degenerates will be caught immediately with all the eyes available. You never knew who is watching all the feeds at where, and you don&rsquo;t feel particularly safe as one of your neighour just disappeared a while ago.</p>

			<p style="color: white;">On the way, you see 2 probe bots running over a kitten nest over and over at the corner of the street, the scream of the cats filled your ears, but you got used to it since you've seen it a million times. <br>
The bots are supposed to be the eyes and tools for people with disability. Things changed when people found a way to hack into their controls and do mischeif under someone else's name. But you still wonder if sometimes the kitten is actually intentionally crushed by a person with disability.</p>

			<p style="color: white;">In class, it&rsquo;s the same boring shit about how to find a job and get paid, how to climb up the societal ladder by getting laid. But what else can you do other than listening and practicing? The world don&rsquo;t revolve around your little head afterall. Sometimes you feel a fire down your heart to yell and break, fortunately it&rsquo;s quickly sedated by the wonderful entertainment on your devices. <br>
And the best thing is, by the algorithm written by whoever at the Copper Valley, you will be seeing your own customized content that no-one else had seen (probably).<br>
By that, whenever you go into an argument online, you&rsquo;d think the other side as stupid as they could never see your perspective of the world, because guess what, they actually did NOT see the world you do because how different your recommendation results are. Polarization is real, people are fighting against eachother in real life, just because some elites tried to make money from your attention by creating all the information cacoon. </p>
