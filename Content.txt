You are Jessie

A student at Empire college studying whatever. Today is like any other week day in Old Dork City. You are to go to school shortly. What adventure awaits you? 

A degenerate who ran away from Empire college. Today is unlike any other day in Old Dork City. You are free to roam and do what the heck is it you like to do. Go get it, tiger!



You waved at the apartment&rsquo;s camera to identify yourself. The system granted you exit and opened the metal door leading to the streets.<br>
There are cameras like this throughout the city, Authority said they are for everyone&rsquo;s safety, as degenerates will be caught immediately with all the eyes available. You never knew who is watching all the feeds at where, and you don&rsquo;t feel particularly safe as one of your neighour just disappeared a while ago.


On the way, you see 2 probe bots running over a kitten nest over and over at the corner of the street, the scream of the cats filled your ears, but you got used to it since you've seen it a million times. <br>
The bots are supposed to be the eyes and tools for people with disability. Things changed when people found a way to hack into their controls and do mischeif under someone else's name. But you still wonder if sometimes the kitten is actually intentionally crushed by a person with disability.

In class, it&rsquo;s the same boring shit about how to find a job and get paid, how to climb up the societal ladder by getting laid. But what else can you do other than listening and practicing? The world don&rsquo;t revolve around your little head afterall. Sometimes you feel a fire down your heart to yell and break, fortunately it&rsquo;s quickly sedated by the wonderful entertainment on your devices. <br>
And the best thing is, by the algorithm written by whoever at the Copper Valley, you will be seeing your own customized content that no-one else had seen (probably).<br>
By that, whenever you go into an argument online, you&rsquo;d think the other side as stupid as they could never see your perspective of the world, because guess what, they actually did NOT see the world you do because how different your recommendation results are. Polarization is real, people are fighting against eachother in real life, just because some elites tried to make money from your attention by creating all the information cacoon. 

Wait, why are you still here? wasting your life away to all the opaque systems build by someone you don&rsquo;t even know? Time to act the one thing you wanted to do eversince you went to kindergarden.


YOU GOT OUT OF THE CAMPUS. THE FIRST THING YOU NOTICED WHEN YOU ARE FINALLY NOT BURDENED TO COMMUTE ON TIME IS THE GRAFFITI LYING ON THE WALLS AROUND THE BLOCK. YOU REMEMBER YOU SAW ON ONE CORNER OF THE INTERNET THAT SOON GOT REDACTED THAT THOSE ARE A MEANS OF REBELLION, A REBELLION FROM THE PEOPLE TO TAKE BACK THE PUBLIC SPACE, THE NATURE, OCCUPIED BY THE GOVERNMENT OR THE CORPORATION THAT THEY SECOND-HANDED BACK TO THE PEOPLE.


HEY, WE GOT A STRAGGLER HERE?!	
DON'T COME CLOSE, I DON'T HAVE ANYTHING ON ME.
WHAT DO YOU MEAN? THE ARCADE CRAZY THURSDAY IS STARTING. OUR GROUP NEEDS ONE MORE PLAYER TO JOIN THE BRACKET. YOU PLAYED VALLEYFIGHTER BEFORE?
UH, I DID WHEN I WAS 10ISH..
ALRIGHT YOU ARE IN, WE'LL SPLIT THE PRIZE WITH YOU, 10 ASTRAS, HOWS IT SOUND?
..I THINK I.
WHATCHU YOU THINK YOU ARE GONNA BUY WITH THAT? I'M THINKING TO GET A NEW PAIR OF GLOVES FOR MY LITTLE SIS, OR A JAR OF CANDY TO THE ARCADE OWNER, AT LEAST THAT'S SOME FAVOR RETURNED.
DO YOU KNOW JIMMY HOSTS THOSE GAMES FOR FREE SO THAT KIDS AROUND CAN HAVE FUN AND HAVE SOME CHANGE TO DO WHAT THEY LIKE? I REMEMBER LAST TIME I...

IT WAS PROBABLY THE MOST FUN AND INTENSE AFTERNOON YOU HAD FOR THIS HALF OF THE YEAR. THE KIDS ABOUT YOUR AGE, ABOVE AND BELOW, WHO ARE IN DIRTY CLOTHS AND HAPPY FACES, SHED SWEAT AND SHARED HUGS IN THE TINY ARCADE SHOP. OF COURSE YOUR TEAM DIDN&rsquo;T WIN THE PRICE, BUT YOU FEEL LIKE YOU'VE WON SOMETHING FAR GREATER.

--warning--

WHILE YOU WERE WALKING HOME, YOU NOTICED A CIRCLE OF CROWD IN FRONT OF A POLICE LINE. YOU LOOK UP TOWARDS THE ROOF OF THE 10ISH STORIES HIGH APARTMENT AND YOU SEE, SO FINALLY ANOTHER SOMEBODY COULDN'T STAND LIVING IN OLD DORK ANYMORE THEY DECIDED TO STAND ON THE EDGE OF THE ROOF TO GIVE THE RESIDENTS OF THE CITY A FINAL SHOW. <br>
UNLIKE USUAL WERE YOU&&rsquo;D TAKE UP YOUR DEVICE TO FILM WHAT&rsquo;S ABOUT TO UNFOLD. YOU FEEL THE FIRE IN YOUR CHEST BURSTING. YOU RUSH INSIDE THE CROWD AND THE POLICE CIRCLE AND YOU START TO SHOUT AT, NOT A CERTAIN SOMEBODY, BUT ANOTHER FELLOW SOUL. YOU FILL THE AIR WITH THE STORY OF YOUR BRAVE ESCAPE AND YOUR ARCADE ECSTASY, SPEAKING OF HOPE AND DEVIATION. <br>
YOU COULDN&rsquo;T SEE THEIR FACE DUE TO THE NIGHT, BUT YOU CAN CLEARLY SEE THEIR MOVEMENT STALL, AND THEY BACK OFF FROM THE EDGE A LITTLE BY LITTLE, FINALLY COLLAPSING TO A FIREFIGHTER BEHIND THEM WHO WAITED PATIENTLY AND AFFECTIONATELY. <br>
YOU ARE NOT SURE IF WHAT YOU SAID HELPED OR IF THEY REMEMBERED THEIR UNFINISHED CHINESE TAKEOUT IN THE FRIDGE. ONE SOUL STAYED IN OLD DORK. DID YOU DO THE RIGHT THING BY SAVING THEM AND DUMPING THEM BACK TO THIS CITY? MAYBE. BUT YOU SURE PLANTED A SEED.


YOU RETURN TO YOUR HOME AT NIGHT. MOM AND DAD IS ALREADY BACK AND IS COOKING FOR YOU. YOU ARE HESITANT TO TELL THEM YOU RAN AWAY DURING THE DAY. BUT YOU DECIDED NOT TO TELL THEM.
AFTER ALL, NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENED DURING THE DAY, FAMILY WILL ALWAYS EMBRACE YOU BY A WELL-COOKED DINNER.(FOOD DISPENSED BY GREEN CO. DOES NOT BEAR RESPONSIBILITY ON FOOD POISONING, VOMIT, CARDIAC-VASCULAR DISEASE...)

YOU GO BACK TO YOUR ROOM AND OPENED UP YOUR NOTEBOOK. HOW WAS YOUR DAY? WHAT WILL YOU DECIDE TO WRITE DOWN?

It is how everyday should be.						Once is enough

You are a BELIEVER. You think that the world is in a good place as it is. You think people in power have enough conscience to lead humanity to a better place, and you should remain a faithful follower to help envision that plan.

You are a FIGHTER. You are not content to the world as it is. You think there is always a way to advance to the betterment of humanity without sacrificing any of the humanity that remains in people.

Yeah, no, just kidding. The above classification is total BS. I made them up just last night. Why be so obsessed with classifications? There are many in this world and most of them are just tags made by other people to group people so they can do HR or identify themselves with others more efficiently. You are unique, you can fall into some of the traits in the classification, but you are so much more than just a group.

That being said. This world is much more than just black and white. In the story of Jessie, you see some terrible things happen and some little goods happen. At the end of the day. The thing you write on the notebook certainly is not binary like this story. This variation is exactly why humanity is so interesting that makes the world so wonderful. There is evil and nasty corners, but sincereity is also here. Don't fret, keep the fire you have down your chest, and keep fighting.


You are not Jessie, you are not some person I told you to be. You are more complicated, you are real. In fact, The entire structure of the website I organized, to tell you to keep positive and keep fighting, is a way of narrative manipulation. I might just be trying to persuade you into doing something for my secret end. Or to keep your eyes away from something awful that happened. So keep your eyes peeled, don't just believe everything you are told/see online.

Am I trying to counter all the points I just made tho? No, what I want to tell you is to open your own eyes, to see the world in its different lens, see not just one fact from one source, make judgements by yourself and . Consider this as my parting lesson for Internet 101 <br>
Now go. Be it online or not, go embrace the world, talk to people, hug them, play with them, converse with them. Make the world a better place, Lightkeeper.
