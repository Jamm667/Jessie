YOU GOT OUT OF THE CAMPUS. THE FIRST THING YOU NOTICED WHEN YOU ARE FINALLY NOT BURDENED TO COMMUTE ON TIME IS THE GRAFFITI LYING ON THE WALLS AROUND THE BLOCK. YOU REMEMBER YOU SAW ON ONE CORNER OF THE INTERNET THAT SOON GOT REDACTED THAT THOSE ARE A MEANS OF REBELLION, A REBELLION FROM THE PEOPLE TO TAKE BACK THE PUBLIC SPACE, THE NATURE, OCCUPIED BY THE GOVERNMENT OR THE CORPORATION THAT THEY SECOND-HANDED BACK TO THE PEOPLE.</p>

IT WAS PROBABLY THE MOST FUN AND INTENSE AFTERNOON YOU HAD THIS YEAR. THE KIDS ABOUT YOUR AGE, ABOVE AND BELOW, WHO ARE IN DIRTY CLOTHS AND HAPPY FACES, SHED SWEAT AND SHARED HUGS IN THE TINY ARCADE SHOP. OF COURSE YOUR TEAM DIDN&rsquo;T WIN THE PRICE, BUT YOU FEEL LIKE YOU'VE WON SOMETHING FAR GREATER.</p>

WHILE YOU WERE WALKING HOME, YOU NOTICED A CIRCLE OF CROWD IN FRONT OF A POLICE LINE. YOU LOOK UP TOWARDS THE ROOF OF THE 10ISH STORIES HIGH APARTMENT AND YOU SEE, SO FINALLY ANOTHER SOMEBODY COULDN'T STAND LIVING IN OLD DORK ANYMORE THEY DECIDED TO STAND ON THE EDGE OF THE ROOF TO GIVE THE RESIDENTS OF THE CITY A FINAL SHOW. <br>
UNLIKE USUAL WERE YOU&&rsquo;D TAKE UP YOUR DEVICE TO FILM WHAT&rsquo;S ABOUT TO UNFOLD. YOU FEEL THE FIRE IN YOUR CHEST BURSTING. YOU RUSH INSIDE THE CROWD AND THE POLICE CIRCLE AND YOU START TO SHOUT AT, NOT A CERTAIN SOMEBODY, BUT ANOTHER FELLOW SOUL. YOU FILL THE AIR WITH THE STORY OF YOUR BRAVE ESCAPE AND YOUR ARCADE ECSTASY, SPEAKING OF HOPE AND DEVIATION. <br>
YOU COULDN&rsquo;T SEE THEIR FACE DUE TO THE NIGHT, BUT YOU CAN CLEARLY SEE THEIR MOVEMENT STALL, AND THEY BACK OFF FROM THE EDGE A LITTLE BY LITTLE, FINALLY COLLAPSING TO A FIREFIGHTER BEHIND THEM WHO WAITED PATIENTLY AND AFFECTIONATELY. <br>
YOU ARE NOT SURE IF WHAT YOU SAID HELPED OR IF THEY REMEMBERED THEIR UNFINISHED CHINESE TAKEOUT IN THE FRIDGE. ONE SOUL STAYED IN OLD DORK. DID YOU DO THE RIGHT THING BY SAVING THEM AND DUMPING THEM BACK TO THIS CITY? MAYBE. BUT YOU SURE PLANTED A SEED.
