	<p class="badtext">Yeah, no, just kidding. The above classification is total BS. I made them up just last night. Why be so obsessed with classifications? There are many in this world and most of them are just tags made by other people to group people so they can do HR or identify themselves with others more efficiently. You are unique, you can fall into some of the traits in the classification, but you are so much more than just a group.</p>

	<p>That being said. This world is much more than just black and white. In the story of Jessie, you see some terrible things happen and some little goods happen. At the end of the day. The thing you write on the notebook certainly is not binary like this story. This variation is exactly why humanity is so interesting that makes the world so wonderful. There is evil and nasty corners, but sincereity is also here. Don't fret, keep the fire you have down your chest, and keep fighting.</p>

		<h1 class="badtext">You are not Jessie</h1>
		<p class="badtext">you are not some person I told you to be. You are more complicated, you are real. In fact, The entire structure of the website I organized, to tell you to keep positive and keep fighting, is a way of narrative manipulation. I might just be trying to persuade you into doing something for my secret end. Or to keep your eyes away from something awful that happened. So keep your eyes peeled, don't just believe everything you are told/see online. </p>

	<p>Am I trying to counter all the points I just made tho? No, what I want to tell you is to open your own eyes, to see the world in its different lens, see not just one fact from one source, make judgements by yourself and not be influenced (not too much at least). Consider this as my parting lesson for Internet 101.<br> <br>
Now go. Be it online or not, go embrace the world, talk to people, hug them, play with them, converse with them. Make the world a better place, Lightkeeper</p>
